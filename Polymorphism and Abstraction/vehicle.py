# Create an abstract class called Vehicle that should have abstract methods drive and refuel.
# Create 2 vehicles that inherit the Vehicle class (a Car and a Truck) and simulate driving and refueling them.
# Car and Truck both receive fuel_quantity and fuel_consumption in liters per km upon initialization.
# They both can be driven a given distance: drive(distance) and refueled with a given amount of fuel: refuel(fuel).
# It is summer, so both vehicles use air conditioners,
# and their fuel consumption per km when driving is increased by 0.9 liters for the car and 1.6 liters for the truck.
# Also, the Truck has a tiny hole in its tank, and when it is refueled, it keeps only 95% of the given fuel.
# The car has no problems and adds all the given fuel to its tank.
# If a vehicle cannot travel the given distance, its fuel does not change.
